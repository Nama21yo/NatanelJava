The first thing to understand about strings is that every string you create is actually 
an object of type String. Even string constants are actually String objects. For example, 
in the statement
System.out.println("This is a String, too");
the string "This is a String, too" is a String object.
The second thing to understand about strings is that objects of type String are immutable; 
once a String object is created, its contents cannot be altered. While this may seem like a 
serious restriction, it is not, for two reasons:
•	 If you need to change a string, you can always create a new one that contains the 
modifications.
•	 Java defines peer classes of String, called StringBuffer and StringBuilder, which 
allow strings to be altered, so all of the normal string manipulations are still available 
in Java. (StringBuffer and StringBuilder are described in Part II of this book.)

The String class contains several methods that you can use. Here are a few. You can test 
two strings for equality by using equals( ). You can obtain the length of a string by calling the 
length( ) method. You can obtain the character at a specified index within a string by calling 
charAt( ).
